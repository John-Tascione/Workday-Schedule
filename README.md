# Workday-Schedule

The workday schedule displays the current date and a card for each hour of the workday. The middle column allows a user to input events for a given hour and the column on the right allows a user to save the event to the local storage. Once an event is saved in the local storage a page refresh will check the local storage for any saved events and render them at the page initiation. 

A screenshot of the page is provided below.
